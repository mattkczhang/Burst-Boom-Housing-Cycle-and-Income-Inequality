## Description

This paper investigates the causality that the dynamic of the housing market causes the increase in income inequality during the burst-boom housing cycle from 2010 to 2014 in US. I used the county level panel data, and employ Pooled Ordinary Least Square, Fixed Effect, and Instrumental Variable specifications to conduct empirical analysis and capture the causality. The empirical evidence suggests that the causality within each county over time is economically and statistically significant, but as I expand the picture to include both cross time and cross county dimensions, the macro-level economic factor indicated by GDP per capita starts to kick in and played a determinant role. In short, building on the empirical result, I conclude that the housing market is explaining a proportion of income inequality caused by the economic development. Future works can be conducted by taking into account of more contemporary political and economic shock within the period of investigation.

## Programming Language

Mostly Stata.

## Data Sources

I used the county level panel data from 2010 to 2014, which, based on the average sales price of houses sold in US published by Federal Reserve, was the beginning part of the burst-boom period. Ideally, a perfectly unbiased individual panel data with large random sample from random control trials across US can provide a precise causality. However, such data does not exist, and county level data that collected through strict randomization and reflect the general picture of regional income inequality is the best alternative I can get. The data were gathered from United States Census Bureau and Zillow3, whose credibility and scope of business can provide the reliable and representative data. After the data cleaning and reshaping, the data included 925 observations, which consisted five consecutive years data in 185 counties.
